The gatherers in this library are categorized into five groups to make things easier to find and understand.

**[Sequence Operations](/gatherers4j/gatherers/sequence-operations/)** which reorder, combine, or manipulate the sequence of elements.

**[Filtering and Selection](/gatherers4j/gatherers/filtering-and-selection/)** which select or remove elements based on some criteria.

**[Grouping and Windowing](/gatherers4j/gatherers/grouping-and-windowing/)** which collect elements into groups or windows.

**[Mathematical Operations](/gatherers4j/gatherers/mathematical/)** which perform calculations over the stream.

**[Validation and Constraints](/gatherers4j/gatherers/validation-and-constraints/)** which enforce conditions on the stream.
